The most challenging problem was to prevent losing the users while the transition. To prevent this, we developed the backend side of the project separately from the current site. On the other hand, we designed the migration script that automatically migrates the database from MySQL to MongoDB. And implementing the AG Grid into the admin panel was one of the challenging problems. We changed some various parts of the base node module of the AG Grid and rearrange the component to build it again.",

We implemented the editor using Google's blockly library. The job involed customizing the editor for Drones and finally turning the generated code blocks into something that Tello drone can understand. You can check how it works from here.  https://dev.droneblocks.io/ It was quite interesting and challening project. The most challening part was exception handling. And also there were some problems with Blockly library itself, so we had to deal with that as well.",
