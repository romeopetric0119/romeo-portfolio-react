      "Well, droneblocks.io was a quite interesting project I have done. The site is about teaching kids copmuter science with Tello drones. Kids can actually develop a program that controls Tello drones using drag and drop editor. My main task was to implement that drag and drop editor. We implemented the editor using Google's blockly library. The job involed customizing the editor for Drones and finally turning the generated code blocks into something that Tello drone can understand. You can check how it works from here.  https://dev.droneblocks.io/ It was quite interesting and challening project. The most challening part was exception handling. And also there were some problems with Blockly library itself, so we had to deal with that as well.",
