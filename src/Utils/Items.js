The website's main feature is the "1-800-LostDog Pet ID Tag," which offers services for quick pet recovery. Users can sign up, register their pets' information, and rely on the tag to facilitate identification and contact in case their pets go missing. The website emphasizes fast recoveries, with an average return time of 30 minutes for lost dogs.
      Additionally, the website offers various membership plans, including health guarantees, breeder support, Embark DNA testing, and high-quality food supply. It also provides services such as secure storage of recovery data, a 24/7 Lost Dog Recovery Hotline, quick printing and emailing of lost dog flyers, and free replacement tags.
      As part of the project, I created a WordPress theme and customized the website's appearance and layout. I integrated Vue.js to add dynamic and responsive components, while Bootstrap ensured a visually appealing and mobile-friendly design.
      Ajax was used for seamless data exchange between the client and server. Apache served as the web server software for reliable content delivery, and Stripe was integrated for secure online payments.
      My responsibilities included configuring the Apache server, integrating the Stripe payment gateway, and developing the WordPress theme. I also ensured smooth user experience through responsive design and interactive components using Vue.js.

It offers a wide range of neon sign designs and collections to suit various spaces and occasions. As a full-stack developer working on the Yellowpop website, I had the opportunity to design and implement the "Design Your Text" page.
      On the "Design Your Text" page, users can create their own customized neon sign by inputting their desired text. They have the flexibility to choose from different font styles, sizes, and colors to personalize their design. The page provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls and real-time visualizations, allowing users to see a preview of their neon sign as they make changes.
      To implement this functionality, I utilized frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interactive user interface. I also integrated backend functionalities using Shopify's platform and APIs to handle user inputs, process the design options, and manage the ordering process.
      Throughout the development process, I ensured that the "Design Your Text" page was responsive and optimized for different devices, providing a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile platforms. I conducted rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues, ensuring the page's stability and reliability.
      By designing and implementing the "Design Your Text" page for Yellowpop, I contributed to enhancing the website's functionality, allowing users to unleash their creativity and customize their own unique neon signs. It was a rewarding experience to be part of a project that empowers users to bring their ideas to life through personalized designs.`,

      "A Chrome extension that blurs all images on a page, for when you want to be discreet or don't want to look at certain images. \nWe’ve all been in a situation where we’ve ‘accidentally’ searched for something online and have seen images we wished we didn’t. \nThen you’ve probably been in a situation where you’re browsing Facebook, Instagram etc. at work or at the library only to spot the person beside you peeping at your screen. \nOr you’ve been in a situation where you just want to read an article without being bombarded by images and videos. \nWell, now, you can. This add on blurs all images and videos on a page so you can focus on what matters. You can choose to view or not view content. \nTo view, just hover over an image for a second to unblur. Done? Just disable the extension from the toolbar.",
